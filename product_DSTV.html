							<h1>DSTV Explora Ultra</h1>
							<p>
								The DSTV Explora Ultra PVR positioned as DSTV's premier product, the Explora Ultra is basically decoder on steriods. It'll have all the satelite-TV capabilities of a normal Explora, but with a bunch of additional functionality. Explora Ultra allow customers to stream third-party content providers' services in 4K resolution third-party providers are believed to include Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. In addition to 4K, the Explora Ultra supports Dolby Atmos. The DSTV Explora Ultra brings the best of two worlds together by introducing streaming apps, adding depth to the entertainment offering available. It also sees the addition of built-in WI-FI, making it easier to connect to the internet. The Explora Ultra includes features previously available to PVR users, including Catch Up, BoxOffice and Showmax. The addition of streaming apps makes the DSTV Explora Ultra the "must-have" device for customers wanting an easy and simple way to enjoy content across many services.

							<h1>DSTV Streama</h1>
							<p>
								This product is where DSTV is changing the game in SA, because the Streama doesn't come equipped with any satelite capabilities. It is akin to any other set top box like Apple TV or Android TV boxes. Multichoice has taken the wraps off its first streaming-only set-top box, the 4K DSTV Streama. No lauch date has been set yet. Pricing is also not available yet. The DSTV Streama is built on top of the RDK platform. This is an "operator-tier platform", designed and built by a collective of broadcasters (including Sky and Comcast). Its secure environment protects content rights holders. RDK was selected because it allows Multichoice to "deliver the best entertainment experience for our customers while enabling flexibility and security". Customers will need a DSTV login, but no active subscription is required to use the DSTV Streama. DSTV Streama users will be able to stream content from DSTV, Showmax and YouTube as well as stream musinc via the Joox app, check the weather by using the People's Weather app and check the latest fixtures, results and scores via the SuperSport app.
